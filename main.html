    <!-- No saviour from on high delivers,
    No faith have we in prince or peer.
    Our own right hand the chains must shiver,
    Chains of hatred, greed and fear.
    E'er the thieves will out with their booty,
    And to all give a happier lot.
    Each at his forge must do their duty,
    And we'll strike the iron while it's hot. -->
